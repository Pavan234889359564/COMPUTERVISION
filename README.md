## About the Project

This project was developed to explore and apply advanced computer vision techniques in a practical setting. The main goals include:

- **Problem Solving:** Addressing specific challenges in image analysisâ€”be it object detection, segmentation, or classification.
- **Innovative Techniques:** Leveraging state-of-the-art algorithms, including deep learning models, to extract insights from visual data.
- **Research and Development:** Providing a framework that can be easily extended for further research or real-world applications.
- **Reproducibility:** Ensuring the code is organized and modular, allowing other researchers or developers to replicate, validate, and improve upon our results.

Throughout the project, emphasis is placed on code clarity, comprehensive documentation, and robust evaluation methods. This ensures that the project can serve as both an educational resource and a foundation for more advanced computer vision solutions.

## Overview

The repository contains all the necessary components to preprocess data, implement the computer vision model, train the model, and evaluate its performance. The primary implementation is contained within a Jupyter Notebook (`CV-FINAL_CODE.ipynb`), which guides you through each step of the process.

## Features

- **Image Preprocessing:** Methods for cleaning, normalizing, and augmenting image data.
- **Model Implementation:** Code for constructing and training a computer vision model.
- **Visualization:** Tools for visualizing training progress, model predictions, and evaluation metrics.
- **Modular Design:** Structured and well-documented code for easy customization and extension.
